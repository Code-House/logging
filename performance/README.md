# Typed Logging Performance tests
This module contains performance comparison with [perf4j](http://perf4j.codehaus.org)

## Results
Results shown below are generated by ```mvn test -DforkMode=always```, so there is not chances to let tests use goodness of JVM bootstraping.

Very basic tests shows that in simplest case - when logging backed is NOOP - typed logging is slower than slf4j calls:
```

Running org.code_house.logging.performance.noop.NoopPlainTest
start[1363779719302] time[28] tag[]
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.114 sec
Running org.code_house.logging.performance.noop.NoopTypedTest
start[1363779719703] time[112] tag[]
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.191 sec
```

First line shows timing for slf4j, second for proxy based logging. Since under the hood we use heavily reflection result is not surprise.

The difference is much smaller when having logging backed plugged:

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.596 sec
```

As you can see for ```100 000``` calls at log level which is log-able typed logging takes only 152 ms more. For ```1 000 000``` calls numbers was 1632ms vs 1980ms.

During my evaluation I've had also unexpected result - typesafe test was faster than slf4j (when re-used JVM). Performance overhead is relatively small.
