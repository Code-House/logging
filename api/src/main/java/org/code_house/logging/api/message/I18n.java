/**
 * This annotation is used to mark that messages should be looked up in Resource Bundle.
 *
 * Default message is always read from Message annotation, in case if there is another variant available for other locale
 * it will place in log file it. If annotation is specified at package level then Message Bundle called "Logging" is used,
 * otherwise simple class name is used.
 * For package resource bundles keys are created from simple class name and method. For type level translations only method
 * name is being used as message key.
 * Formatting of message arguments such {0,time}, {1,date} in not available since all arguments are passed to slf4j, thus
 * the same order of elements is forced and usage of {} for arguments instead of indexed variant.
